## Questions for Hiyield!

- **Bcorp**: I'm very interested in your association with Bcorp and the benefits it brings for both your team and the clients.
The committment to sustainability and being ethical in business is something i'm invested into, it's a very powerful tool
for building trust and loyalty with clients when developing a new product - I believe this is most important having a postive
relationship with the client. **Could you share how this certification influences the development life cycle of a project.
I'm also interested how Hiyield integrates the commitment to environmental factors on a day-to-day basis.**

- **Responsibilities**: **What are the specific responsibilities an Apprentice would have in terms of the typical tasks they would undertake
daily and how this contributes to the broader scope of a project. Also, i'm intrigued to find out about guidance and supervision. As skills develop,
will the apprentice have progressive responsibility for a task or will there always be an opportunity for mentorship and assistance.**
