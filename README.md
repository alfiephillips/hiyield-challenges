## Overview

This repository showcases my solutions to the Hiyield Apprenticeship Challenge, designed for the role of Apprentice Software Developer. The project spans several key aspects of web development, focusing on both front-end and back-end technologies.

## Questions for Hiyield!

- **Bcorp**: I'm very interested in your association with Bcorp and the benefits it brings for both your team and the clients.
The committment to sustainability and being ethical in business is something i'm invested into, it's a very powerful tool
for building trust and loyalty with clients when developing a new product - I believe this is most important having a postive
relationship with the client. **Could you share how this certification influences the development life cycle of a project?
I'm also interested how Hiyield integrates the commitment to environmental factors on a day-to-day basis?**

- **Responsibilities**: **What are the specific responsibilities an Apprentice would have in terms of the typical tasks they would undertake
daily and how would this contribute to the broader scope of a project? Also, i'm intrigued to find out about guidance and supervision. As skills develop,
will the apprentice have progressive responsibility for a task or will there always be an opportunity for mentorship and assistance?**

- **Development Life Cycle**: I noticed on your website you have recently completed collaborations with BizSpace and Stowable.
**How is a bespoke solution such as these developed from conception to launch. Hence, could you please walk me through the development life cycle at Hiyield and
what is considered?**
